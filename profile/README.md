# Helsinki Gophers

This is the GitHub page for the [Helsinki Gophers meetup group]. We meet in
person to discuss topics related to Go programming language. The meetup group
is part of the [Go Developers Network].

See [meetups] for past meetups.

## Join the fun

Keep an eye on the meetup page for upcoming meetups. Between meetups, many
people are also in the `#finland` channel in the [Gophers slack].

## Contributing

A meetup community is only a community with active contributions from its
members. By joining a meetup and participating in discussion, you're already
contributing!

### Become a speaker üé§

Speaking at a meetup is a fantastic way to get experience with public speaking.
This is a safe space with a supporting group of people who all want to see you
succeed. It's also a good way to get your name out for potential employers or
employees. Finally, it's fun and very rewarding!

Talks can be full length (30-40min) or lightning talks (5-7). A full length
talk typically covers a few different related topics, while a lightning talk is
more of a quick appetizer on one topic. There's room for questions and
discussion.

What should you talk about? That's up to you! There are no specific
requirements, other than the talks being Go-related. Feel free to interpret
that how you want. The talk can be for a beginner or advanced target and also
talks from newbies to Go are more than welcome to share their experience
getting their feet wet. The best way to learn something is to teach it, so this
is a good opportunity to dive deep into something. For new speakers it's often
easier to talk about something you're already familiar with (maybe some problem
you solved at work).

### Become a host üèüÔ∏è

The biggest hurdle in hosting a meetup is finding a venue that can host the
group. Please get in touch if your company has such as a space.

In order to be practical for Helsinki Gophers meetups, the space should:

- Be relatively easily accessible from Helsinki/close by
- Available to fit 50-100 people
- Have a screen for presentations

We can figure out all the details, in case there are specific requirements.

Sponsoring a meetup is a great way to get the name out to the community, which
often results in attracting top talent to the company. You'll also get company
logo on the meetup page under the sponsors section. Host companies also get
priority in talks (if they want) and will get time to talk about how the
company uses Go, talk about open jobs, etc.

### Become a sponsor ü§©

If you're a company would like to support the community but don't have a space
to offer, then other sponsorship is also possible. Examples here could be
paying for renting a venue, sponsoring food/drinks or providing [Go-related]
swag, givaways, software licenses, discounts, etc.

### Become a co-organizer ü¶∏

Organizing a meetup takes time and energy. If you're interesting in helping
out, please reach out üòä
